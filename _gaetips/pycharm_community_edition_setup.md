title: Run GAE server with PyCharm Community Edition 
---
PyCharm Pro has a builtin support for GAE applications but that's not so hard to run GAE apps with Community Edition. 

1. Specify an absolute path to `appcfg.py` (a part of GAE SDK) as an execution script. 
2. Set up a directory with `app.yaml` as a working directory.
